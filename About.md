#What Is This?

This is a real time multiplayer web browser game developed at the annual UMBC Game Jam. It was inspired by Agar.io, Slither.io, and Diep.io. 

It doesn't look 100% polished, but all the art assets were made from scratch, and this was a first attempt. If you have any feedback or ideas for improvement please tweet or contact me at my email address: [sz60171@umbc.edu](mailto:sz60171@umbc.edu)

#How Do I Play?

Use the WASD or Arrow keys on your keyboard to move around. Holding down the Spacebar will speed you up. Use the left mouse click button to shoot a bullet at enemy. Each player starts off with a certain amount of health that is reduced when they're hit by an enemy bullet but can be replenished by picking up the eggs that randomly spawn on the map. Players are ranked in the according to their Kill/Death ratio.

#What Else Can I Do?
You can change the name of your player, respawn, and change the type of character you play as.
